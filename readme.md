# Icy Bird

Welcome to the Icy Bird Game!

## Implementation

Implemented a flappy bird alternative, Icy Bird, using PyGame.
Used OOP to organize code

## Game instructions

- Run main.py
- Press mouse left key to make the bird fly up
- Score a point every time bird passes through a set of pipes
- Game is over when bird hits the ceiling, the ground, or a pipe
- Adjust scrolling speed and pipe frequency according to computer's speed on lines 19 and 23 in main.py

Enjoy!

To implement: sound when jumping or dying
